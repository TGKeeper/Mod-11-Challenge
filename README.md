Module 11 Challenge

• Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
• Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
Installation and Usage
This project is not open for contributions, as it is a homework assignment only. Please do not copy, modify, or distribute this code without permission.

My main dataframe is called MarsDF & can be found exported to a csv called "Mel's MarsDF.csv". 


Credits
This project was created by me primarily referencing the material covered in class, but I did (for once) find some decent information for several scenarios at pydata.org. I also figured out the last graph (in part) by looking at https://www.sharpsightlabs.com/blog/matplotlib-line-chart/.
